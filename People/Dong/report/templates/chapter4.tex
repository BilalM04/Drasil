We can write a linear system of first-order ODE in shape of 
\begin{equation} \label{eq_foode}
    \boldsymbol{X}' = \boldsymbol{AX} + \boldsymbol{c}
\end{equation}

The \textbf{A} is a coefficient matrix, and c is a constant vector. The \textbf{X} is the unknown vector contains functions of the independent variable, often time. The \textbf{X}' is a vector that consist of first derivative of functions in \textbf{X}.
