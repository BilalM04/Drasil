\chapter{Connect Model to Libraries}
External libraries come from an outside source and do not originate from the source project, and many of them can solve scientific problems. If we utilize them in the Drasil framework, those libraries can help to solve many scientific problems. One way to use external libraries is to create proper interfaces connecting the program and external libraries.

We can write a linear system of first-order ODE in shape of 
\begin{equation} \label{eq_foode}
    \boldsymbol{X}' = \boldsymbol{AX} + \boldsymbol{c}
\end{equation}

The \textbf{A} is a coefficient matrix, and c is a constant vector. The \textbf{X} is the unknown vector contains functions of the independent variable, often time. The \textbf{X}' is a vector that consist of first derivative of functions in \textbf{X}.
