Intro 2
Drasil is a framework that generates software, including code, documentation, software requirement specification, user manual, axillary files, and so on. Recently, the Drasil team has been interested in expanding its knowledge to solve a higher-order ODE.

new structure 3 
A ODE could existed in various forms and some forms was designed for specific purposes. We designed a flexible structure to store ODE information base on conventional mathematical knowledge. This would allow ODEs be isomorphic, which means we can map one ODE form to others.

analysis on external libraries 3 
We also provide commonalities analysis on four selected external libraries. The analysis includes on how the interface looks like, what algorithm they used to solve the ODE, and what other options for outputting a different type.

automate the process 3
enable Draisl Code Generator solve higher-order ODE with manually extracted information. We create a new case study, Double Pendulum, that has a system of higher-order ODE. Further, we solve the Double Pendulum example numerically via external libraries. We also automatically extract information from newly created structure for solving a single higher-order linear ODE

summary 2
able to solve any higher order ODE with manually written equations
automate manually creation part for a single higher-order ODE

The generated code solves the ODE numerically
