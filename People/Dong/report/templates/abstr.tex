Drasil is a framework that generates software, including code, documentation, software requirement specification, user manual, axillary files, and so on. Recently, the Drasil team has been interested in expanding its knowledge to solve a higher-order ODE. Firstly, we designed a flexible and reusable structure to store ODE information based on conventional mathematical knowledge. This makes it possible to reuse ODE information for other purposes, such as solving the ODE. Secondly, we also provide a commonality analysis of four selected external libraries. The analysis includes how they solve the ODE, what algorithm they used to solve the ODE, and what other options are for outputting a different type. Lastly, we enable Draisl Code Generator to solve higher-order ODEs with manually extracted information. We created a new case study, Double Pendulum, that has a system of higher-order ODE. Further, we solve the Double Pendulum example numerically via external libraries. We also automatically extract essential information for generating code from the newly created structure.

This research accomplishes three main goals. Firstly, we capture the knowledge of ODE in a flexible and reusable structure. Secondly, we expand the Drasil capability to solve any higher-order ODEs with manually written equations. The last one is removing the duplicated information caused by the implementation of solving ODEs.
