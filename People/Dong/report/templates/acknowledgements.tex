I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my supervisors, Dr. Spencer Smith and Dr. Jacques Carette. With their guides, I able to break a complex puzzle into smaller pieces and accomplish them one by one. I spent 90\% of my time in remote learning, but the quality of knowledge I received beyond learning in-person. My supervisors quickly adapt the work rhythm during the pandemic, and I was greatly benefited from it.
