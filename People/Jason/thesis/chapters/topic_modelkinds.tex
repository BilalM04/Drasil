\section{Problem}

\begin{itemize}

	\item It's important that each knowledge encoding in Drasil exposes as much
	      information as reasonably possible (and useful). \todo{this is still
		      very vague} We want to expose the ``specifications'' of each piece
          of knowledge that we are encoding.

	\item With mathematical models, it's very easy to write ``difficult to
	      interpret'' expressions, and create expressions for which aren't
	      directly calculable (i.e., things that require an extra paper and
	      pencil/mental mathematics before performing).

	\item Since we want to generate code that represents calculations of all
	      sorts, it's important that the mathematical expression language we
	      use to write calculations expose sufficient information to the
	      generator in a concise and easy-to-digest manner.

	\item For example, assuming the following expressions are written using
	      the existing mathematical Expr language in Drasil...
	      \begin{itemize}

		      \item While \(y = x\) might conventionally be seen as ``y is
		            defined by x'', we might want, in our model, for it to be
		            understood as ``x is defined by y'' but displayed differently.

		      \item \(a = b = c = ... = d\) can be ambiguously read ...

		      \item Truth statements such as \(y < x\) might ...

		      \item \todo{list problems}

	      \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements \& properties of a good solution}

\begin{itemize}

	\item We should be able to better interpret mathematical expressions
	      by having model containers form them. In other words, making
	      proper containers for the models/theories and having the original
          expression generated from the containers, that describe specific
          kinds of theories, 

	\item Specifically, more expressions should be usable in code generation.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Solution}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Splitting Expr into CodeExpr, ModelExpr, and Expr
	
    \item ModelKinds
	
    \item Replacing RelationConcepts usage \todo{``higher level'' encodings}
