With a focus on building Scientific Computing Software, Drasil is an
exploration of this idea. Rather than building one's software project in any
single or combination of general purpose programming language, the usage of a
sequence of domain-specific languages together in Drasil-based projects can be
used to describe common undergraduate level physics models and problems and
describe the target program that simulates said models.
