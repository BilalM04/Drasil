\section{Background: Problem}

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Writing invalid expressions is possible.
    
    \item Mentally tracking expression creations to ensure they follow
          the implicit rules of the expression language is too difficult,
          and leads to mental strain.

    \item Compiling to ``lower languages'' requires special type checking
          before compiling to them. \todo{Swift needed special Doubles}
    
    \item Dynamically checking for invalid expression states is possible,
          but difficult and would result in increasingly difficult term
          tracking as terms in the expression language grow/are added.

    \item In general, being able to express invalid expressions causes
          large burden and mental overhead.
    
\end{itemize}


\section{Requirements \& properties of a good solution}

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Invalid expressions should be irrepresentable in the various 
          expression languages (i.e., the expression types should strictly
          indicate valid expression constructions), without loss of generality.
    
    \item Invalid expression formation attempts should be statically found
          and reported by the compiler, at compile-time. This will move the 
          previously runtime errors to comple-time.

    \item Invalid expression cases should not need to be considered when
          working (e.g., case-ing) with expressions.

    \item \todo{``Safety = Preservation + Progress'' (PFPL, Ch.6)}
    
    \item \todo{Expressions must be terminating.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Solution}

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Splitting Expr into 3 variants; Expr, CodeExpr, and ModelExpr.
          \todo{this is the same note as in topic \#2s solution, perhaps merge?}
          This allows us to both segregate terms to particular domains, and
          add weak typing where necessary, as required (e.g., areas where we
          we might require a dependently typed host language).
    
    \item Use TTF encodings of the smart constructors to lessen the cognitive load
          of handling at least 3 different expression languages.

    \item Statically type all 3 variants of Expr through GADTs.

    \item \todo{Inference rule trees? Similar to PFPL textbook}

\end{itemize}
