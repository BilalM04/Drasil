\section{Background: Problem}

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Writing invalid expressions is possible.
    
    \item Mentally tracking expression creations to ensure they follow the
          implicit rules of the expression language is too difficult, and leads
          to mental strain.

    \item Compiling to ``lower languages'' requires special type checking before
          compiling to them. \todo{Swift needed special Doubles}
    
    \item Dynamically checking for invalid expression states is possible, but
          difficult and would result in increasingly difficult term tracking as
          terms in the expression language grow/are added.

    \item In general, being able to express invalid expressions causes large
          burden and mental overhead.
    
\end{itemize}


\section{Requirements \& properties of a good solution}

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Invalid expressions should be irrepresentable in the various expression
          languages (i.e., the expression types should strictly indicate valid
          expression constructions), without loss of generality.
    
    \item Invalid expression formation attempts should be statically found and
          reported by the compiler, at compile-time. This will move the
          previously runtime errors to compile-time.

    \item Invalid expression cases should not need to be considered when working
          (e.g., case-ing) with expressions.

    \item ``Safety = Preservation + Progress'' (\cite{harper2016pfpl}, Ch.6)
    
    \item \intodo{Expressions must be terminating.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Solution}

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Splitting Expr into 3 variants; Expr, CodeExpr, and ModelExpr.
          This allows us to both segregate terms to particular domains, and add
          weak typing where necessary, as required (e.g., areas where we might
          require a dependently typed host language).

            \item \url{https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/issues/1220}
          \end{itemize}
    
    \item Use TTF encodings of the smart constructors to lessen the cognitive
          load of handling at least 3 different expression languages.

    \item Statically type all 3 variants of Expr through GADTs.
