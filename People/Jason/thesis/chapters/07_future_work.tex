\begin{itemize}

      \item This document will contain knowledge regarding the Expression language
            that is shown in Haskell code, but not quite in our encodings. To
            further improve Drasil, one of the next ``obvious'' steps is to
            transcribe the knowledge involved with writing any language down as
            well. An excruciating amount of knowledge is everywhere.

      \item The unit and dimension related to numbers is another project on its
            own. It will need to be added to calculate the units of operations and
            ensure that representations are appropriate for their (precision vs
            accuracy as Dr. Smith mentioned).
