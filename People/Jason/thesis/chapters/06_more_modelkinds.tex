\section{Success}
\label{chap:more-theory-kinds:sec:success}

\ModelKind{} already has some success in enabling more theories to be encoded in
Drasil and used for code generation.

Dong Chens Master's involved exploring \acsp{ode} in Drasil and using them to
generate code that solves them \cite{Chen2022MEng}.

Through his work, we have already observed some success because more case
studies are already capable of generating code (see
\refCaseStudiesCodeTableAfterDongsWork{}).

Namely, \acs{dblpendulum} has working code generation for 4 languages (Python,
Java, C/C\(++\), and C\#), and \acs{pdcontroller} now also supports Java,
C/C\(++\), and C\# in addition to Python.
