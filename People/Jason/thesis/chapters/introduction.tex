\section{Problem Statement}

In Drasil, we are focused on understanding families of scientific software, and
creating systematic rules to generate families of software solutions (for any
instance of a scientific problem that requires a scientific software solution).
Specifically, Drasil is focused on mathematics and physics-based models. In both
areas, we are concerned with what \textit{kinds of theories} are
well-understood, and ensuring that all created mathematical expressions are
``valid''.

\section{Contributions of the Author}

\begin{itemize}
      \item The problem of obtaining more information from our theories so that we
            may make better use from their meta-level information was understood
            before this work.
      \item A partial solution to this problem was also constructed before this
            work.
      \item The expression language used to build theories and, ultimately, inputs
            to outputs was constructed before this work.
\end{itemize}

\section{Thesis Outline}

In chapter X, we discuss \dots
\begin{enumerate}
      \setcounter{enumi}{1}
      \item \autoref{chap:ideology}: discuss the ideology underpinning this work.
      \item \autoref{chap:drasil}: the Drasil project, it's history, and it's
            architecture.
      \item \autoref{chap:modelkinds}: how theories are encoded in Drasil, the
            problems associated, and the progress made by this work.
      \item \autoref{chap:typedExpr}: how expressions are encoded in Drasil, the
            problems associated, and the progress made by this work.
      \item \autoref{chap:knowledgeMgmt}: discuss how knowledge is captured in
            Drasil, the problems associated, and discuss how we may improve it.
      \item \autoref{chap:futureWork}: discuss potential future work as a
            continuation of the progress made by the contributions of this work.
\end{enumerate}

\intodo{The above points are easy to merge. I should just do it, soon.}
