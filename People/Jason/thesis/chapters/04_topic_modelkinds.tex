% ModelKinds -- Theory types / discrimination -- ``Expressions in context''

In working to understand some phenomenon, we often look to the boundaries of our
understandings of the phenomenon â€” the open-ended questions and gaps in our
knowledge. In any domain of knowledge (such as mathematics, philosophy, physics,
chemistry, biology, computer science, or any other studied subject), we often
think about various phenomenon in logical terms of theories and axioms, where
the theories and axioms are written using a global logical language with precise
meanings. The language is typically tailored to the field of knowledge. As this
work pertains to Drasil, one language of interest to this research is that of
the mathematical language. A mathematical language is heavily used in science,
conveying important theories, axioms, corollaries, amongst other things. As
mathematicians transferring knowledge to one another, we often use a written
form of knowledge, though unlikely, potentially with a precise structure to our
transcription of the knowledge, but still, the structure is textual. We might
break up the transcription of the knowledge into sections. The sections of a
theory might perhaps have a name, a description, a derivation, some information
on it's origin (e.g., a reference), and some sort of information in a language
we can use to convey the important information we decided to share. Of course,
for a mathematical theory, a mathematical language would be used. Describing a
programming language artifact, we might prefer to call our theories by a series
of other names (e.g., functions/methods, constants, modules, statements,
variables, etc.), and prefer to use the parts of the AST of a programming
language to describe our theories.

In Drasil, both of these languages are of great importance. The mathematical
field of knowledge is directly used in at least two domains currently captured;
the scientific theories, and \acs{gool}\cite{Carette2019}. Meanwhile, the
programming language theory (artifacts) is only directly used in \acs{gool}, and
it's various renderers. The SmithEtAl \acs{srs} \cite{SmithAndLai2005} template
generator uses knowledge transcribed as scientific requirements to automatically
generate a series of representational software programs. In the SmithEtAl
generator doing this, Drasil requires a comprehensive understanding of both
fields. The focus of the scientific requirements documents are to transcribe the
relevant knowledge of a scientific system as developed by a domain/scientific
expert. For example, \todo{SRS document example} is used to fully explain
\todo{something} such that a software developer can construct a program based on
it. Of course, if the SRS document is to be truly sufficient for a software
developer to unambiguously create a representational software artifact, then the
software developer (who potentially knows nothing about the domain discussed in
the \acs{srs} document) will need to be able to credibly transcribe everything
into their program, matching the requirements as set by the \acs{srs} document.
As Drasil is an apparatus for testing our understanding of phenomenon, the
SmithEtAl template is being tested for its confidence in this regard (and is
being shown to work). However, if the process is to be truly
``assembly-line''-able, then we should be able to mechanize it.

In Drasil, a proof of concept of this understanding is being built. In
particular, the SmithEtAl template is being attempted to be systematically used
to generate a family of software artifacts in a variety of \acl{oo} programming
languages through building \ACF{gool} programs.

In order for Drasil to generate software artifacts that solve problems, it must
have a way of discussing the space your problem lies in, and the ways it can be
transformed into the working calculation steps that a software artifact can
follow to solve your problem.

\begin{itemize}

	\item Creates a ``calculation path'' for a series of $x = f(a,b,c,...)$
	      formed equations (e.g., simple LHS = complex RHS), and ODEs
	      supported by python libraries.

	\item The calculation path relies (implicitly) on:
	      \begin{itemize}

		      \item The Exprs of the RelationConcept being of the form: $x =
			            f(a,b,c,...)$

		      \item The ODEs being described by the expression language, but
		            we do not rely on being able to generate representing
		            computational code due to needing extra external
		            information (e.g., we require a supplementary packet of
		            information [ODEInfo]).

\originalExprHaskell

The original smart constructors were specific to Expr:

Theories were transcribed using ``RelationConcepts'':

Where ``Relations'' are merely an alias for Expr:

\theoriesWithoutModelKinds

With ModelKinds, we, approximately, obtain the following:

\theoriesWithModelKinds

We split up Expr into 3 kinds of expression languages that better fit our needs.

\section{Problem}

\begin{itemize}

	\item In modelling any problem, one will, of course, model the work of their
	      pencil and paper. Thankfully, with scientific problems, the
	      well-understood ones will be codified\cite{well-understood}, and as
	      such, are a good fit for Drasil, as it is intended to automatically
	      generate software that performs calculations for a specific problem in
	      the universe of generic programs supported.

	\item In most, if not all, physics problems, a common language of mathematic
	      calculation. In Drasil, this language is written as an \ACF{adt} in
	      \refOriginalExprHaskell{}.

	\item Here, we explain that a mathematical expression is defined by the
	      above \acf{ast}. The language contains the commonly found operations
	      in a well-understood physics textbook (here, with a focus on
	      graduate-level scientific problems).

	\item It is important that each knowledge encoding in Drasil exposes as much
	      information as reasonably possible (and useful). We want to expose the
	      ``specifications'' of each piece of knowledge that we are encoding so
	      that transformers and generators may appropriately make use of
	      contained knowledge.

	\item It is very easy to write ``difficult/impossible to interpret''
	      expressions. For example, it is possible to create expressions for
	      which aren't directly calculable (i.e., things that require an extra
	      paper and pencil/mental mathematics before performing), either without
	      extra surrounding information or simply impossible.

	      \begin{itemize}

		      \item When writing a pencil \& paper, we usually write with extra
		            context (generally more information that needs to be read to
		            fully understand some expression). We might also infer
		            information about the model. Unfortunately, mechanizing
		            inference is difficult, artificial learning is a whole field
		            of study of its own. As such, we reverse the relationship of
		            the inference by having knowledge container expose
		            everything on its own. We additionally expect knowledge as a
		            requisite to working with the model.

		      \item In other words, we replace Expr as a knowledge container,
		            and restrict its usage to strictly ``expressions'', as
		            opposed to ``expressions'' and information about models.

	      \end{itemize}

	\item Since we want to generate code that represents calculations of all
	      sorts, it's important that the mathematical expression language we use
	      to write calculations expose sufficient information to the generator
	      in a concise and easy-to-digest manner.

	\item For example, assuming the following expressions are written using the
	      existing mathematical Expr language in Drasil\ldots{}
	      \begin{itemize}

		      \item While \(y = x\) might conventionally be seen as ``y is equal
		            to x'', we might want, in our model, for it to be understood
		            as ``x is defined by y'' but displayed differently.

		      \item \(a = b = c = ... = d\) can be ambiguously read\ldots{}

		      \item Truth statements such as \(y < x\) might be usable in
		            asserting constraints at software runtime, but it's
		            difficult to find a place for it to belong without extra
		            context.

	      \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements \& properties of a good solution}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Expressions are great for viewing, but not for a computer to
	      systematically use to generate things.

	\item Theories should expose more information about themselves so that we
	      can directly interpret them without needing to traverse over an
	      expression.

	\item Specifically, more expressions should be usable in code generation,
	      amongst other things.

\end{itemize}

\section{Solution}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Mathematical expressions may have definitive meanings at different
	      levels of interpretation. Splitting our focal expression language into
	      3 variants is easy thanks to GADTs and TTF \cite{Carette2009};
	      CodeExpr, ModelExpr, and Expr. This will allow us to restrict terms to
	      the different levels of interpretation through a common type (either
	      using the GADT, or the TTF constraints).

	\item Splitting Expr into 3 variants; Expr, CodeExpr, and ModelExpr. This
	      allows us to both segregate terms to particular domains, and add weak
	      typing where necessary, as required (e.g., areas where we might
	      require a dependently typed host language).

	      \begin{itemize}

		      \item
		            \url{https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/issues/1220}

	      \end{itemize}


	\item Replacing ``RelationConcepts'':

	      \begin{itemize}

		      \item Using raw expressions to transcribe whole mathematical
		            theories and data structures leads to many problems and
		            difficulties in interpretation alone.

		      \item Replacing raw expressions with ``encodings one step higher''
		            that can push out the same raw expressions as a property of
		            the higher-level encodings will allow us to quickly
		            identify, discriminate, and efficiently use the information
		            originally contained in the expressions better. This is done
		            through replacing ``RelationConcepts'' with ``ModelKinds'':

		      \item \currentModelKindsHaskell

		      \item \intodo{Discuss EquationalModels, EquationalRealms,
			            EquationalConstraints, DEModel, NewDEModel, etc.}

		      \item We can still push out ModelExprs and Exprs from things where
		            necessary, if they can be explained using them.

		      \item \intodo{Justify type parameters everywhere}

	      \end{itemize}
