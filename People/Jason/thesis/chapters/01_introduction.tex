As the world increasingly relies on software and non-executable software
artifacts, the software becomes increasingly scrutinized in multiple facets.
Does a piece of software do what I want/need? Is it stable? Is it reliable? What
methods does it use? What do its components mean? Are its outputs accurate and
precise? Is it performant? Is it efficient? Further, to each answer, one might
ask: How do we know? Often, we look to the source code and its development to
justify responses to these questions. Where a requirements specification and a
software design is built, we can spend time investigating that the source code
conforms to the manuals, and that the manuals form satisfactory answers to our
questions. Where a manual is not built, we must spend time studying source code
to respond to these questions, perhaps even comparing them to a control group
program. However, this is terribly arduous process. Realistically, the answers
to these questions should have been already well-understood before the final
software product was formed, even if the answer was to ignore the question until
later. Drasil \cite{Drasil2021} looks to form answers to these same questions
through \textit{definition}. Using generative techniques, Drasil builds software
that conforms to specifications \textit{perfectly} by having all relevant
information of the specifications and how they translate into some software
artifacts well-understood to Drasil. This thesis aims to explore these ideas
through exploring capturing mathematical knowledge in Drasil.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:intro:problemStatement}

In the land of scientific software, mathematical knowledge and it's conversion
into software is of utmost importance to ensure the software is:

\intodo{I think I saw some better worded goals previously? TODO: Check Dan's work and Brook's work}
\begin{enumerate}

      \item \textbf{Ready \& Safely Usable} The software should be able to
            easily reach the runtime phase, and should never run into unexpected
            issues at runtime.

      \item \textbf{Reliable} The user of the software should be able to trust
            and feel comfortable that the software does as expected.

      \item \textbf{Accurate} The software should be a correct depiction of all
            aspects of the needs of the software.

      \item \textbf{Traceable} Partially related to being accurate, the
            ``accuracy'' should be traceable to the knowledge used to form the
            software.

      \item \textbf{Performant and efficient} The software should be slim, use
            only as much system resources as needed, and perform tasks within a
            reasonably usable and actionable time.

\end{enumerate}

As part of Drasil's focus, this mathematical knowledge must become sufficiently
codified such that users may be able to build a program \textit{perfectly}
representing its \ACF{srs}. In other words, building programs exactly according
to the precise problem it solves by understanding the relevant definitions and
descriptions (using a specific \acs{srs}). By doing this, Drasil will be able to
reliably and flexibly generate a host of \acs{stem}-related software artifacts.

\section{Contributions of the Author}
\label{sec:intro:contributions}

\intodo{Rewrite point form notes in ``Contributions of the Author'' section.}

\begin{itemize}

      \item The problem of obtaining more information from our theories so that
            we may make better use from their meta-level information was
            understood before this work.

      \item A prototype/partial solution\todo{Add the prototype to the appendix,
                  and reference it here.} to this problem was also constructed before
            this work.

      \item The expression language used to build theories and, ultimately,
            inputs to outputs was constructed before this work.

\end{itemize}

\section{Thesis Outline}
\label{sec:intro:outline}

In \Cref{chap:ideology}, we discuss the focal ideology underpinning this work
and Drasil. \Cref{chap:drasil} describes Drasil, the host project carrying the
fruits of this work. \Cref{chap:modelkinds} discusses how theories are encoded
in Drasil, the issues associated with using a single universal mathematical
language to describe theories, and how we can resolve these problems.
\Cref{chap:typedExpr} describes residual issues associated with validating and
transcribing mathematical expressions. \Cref{chap:knowledgeMgmt} continues to
discuss the ways in which general knowledge and theories are encoded in Drasil,
and methods for altering their encoding, leading into \cref{chap:futureWork},
where we discuss future work.
