When developing software, developers pull information from a common pool of
domain-specific knowledge, including the requirements and related fields (such
as physics and financial mathematics). The pool is common, but not necessarily
formally shared, leading to issues in synchronization, communication, and
understanding, all of which harm the final software produced in some way. As
knowledge changes, software artifacts are slow-moving to adjust, requiring
continued development. For well-understood domains, such as \ACF{scs}, where
there exists commonly agreed upon ``knowledge'' and software is somehow usable,
Drasil aims to capture domain-specific knowledge and use a generative approach
to build software as \textit{view} of the captured knowledge. Drasil is a suite
for \textit{generative software development}.

Currently focusing on \acs{scs}, Drasil uses a stable scientific knowledge-base
to generate families of \acs{scs} conforming to a \ACF{srs}
\cite{SmithAndLai2005}. By formalizing the language associated with an \acf{srs}
document (such as symbols, units, mathematical expressions, theories, etc.) and
how the language terms translate into other languages, Drasil is capable of
generating \acs{scs} conforming to a \acf{srs}, improving consistency,
traceability, understandability, maintainability, and reusability of the
\acf{scs} (but, more importantly, of the domain-specific knowledge as a whole,
as well).

Specifically, in this thesis, we will explore capturing mathematical theories
frequently pulled from in building \acs{scs}, typing mathematical expressions,
restricting mathematical expression usage to appropriate contexts, and scaling
Drasils knowledge database.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:intro:background}

Intended to ``generate all the things''\footnote{``Generate All the Things'' is
      Drasils tagline.},
\porthref{Drasil}{https://jacquescarette.github.io/Drasil/} is a
Haskell-based \cite{Haskell2010} software suite studying how knowledge
capture may improve modern software development. ``Knowledge'' is
considered ``captured'' in Drasil by codifying it and its relations to
other things using \ACFP{dsl} encoded as Haskells data types. For example,
``quantities'' (\QuantityDict{}s), as we've currently needed from a
physics-based point-of-view, are encoded as:

\originalQuantityDictHaskell{}

And an instance of a ``quantity'' might appear as:\\

\originalQuantityDictExampleHaskell{}

The ways that we can translate ``quantities'' into other ``things'' are encoded
as Haskell-level functions and instances of typeclasses, such as:

\intodo{Code snippet: example of how QuantityDicts are converted into at least 1
      or 2 other things (e.g., SRS rows, symbols, etc.).}

These codified pieces of ``knowledge'' are known as \textit{chunks} in Drasil,
and are collected in a single database (\refOriginalChunkDBHaskell) of typed
maps of chunks, referenced by their \ACFP{uid}. Drasil is developed through a
``bottom-up'' methodology against several \acs{scs} case studies
(\refCaseStudiesTable{}), capturing and de-duplicating knowledge as needed to
re-generate the original artifacts and more, in a wide variety of similarly
applicable languages. For example, Drasil makes use of the similarities of
\ACF{oo} languages by forming expressions in \ACF{gool} before compiling to the
specific instances of \acs{oo} languages (such as Java, C/C\+\+, C\#, Python,
etc.). Similarly, textual markup can be exported in similar languages, such as
\acs{html} and \LaTeX{}.

For example, the \ACF{glassbr} case study (examining predicting whether a glass
slab can withstand an explosive blast) had \porthref{software
      artifacts}{https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/tree/master/CaseStudies/glass}
manually written. A coherent net of knowledge/discussion (a ``story'') is then
formed by dissecting the artifacts, understanding why each piece existed, what
it relates to and how, and how it can be translated into other things. The
original artifacts are then
\porthref{re-generated}{https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/tree/master/code/stable/glassbr}
in a wider variety of other languages by codifying how the net of knowledge can
be translated into other languages.

However, not all the case studies are capable of generating software artifacts
yet (\refCaseStudiesCodeTable{}). Each for their own reason, but we will focus
on a critical common denominator between them all: capturing mathematical
knowledge for reliable \acs{scs} artifact generation (and more).

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:intro:problemStatement}

Domain-specific abstractions are what enable domain-specific
\textit{interpretation and transformation} (e.g., optimization, analysis, error
checking, tool support, etc.) \cite{Czarnecki2005}. The capture of
domain-specific knowledge (through abstractions) is which is what sets
\acsp{dsl} apart from general-purpose programming languages. Drasil relies on a
\textit{network of domains} (a network of domain knowledge connected by
\aclp{dsl}) to enable the complex information transformation needed to convert
an \acs{srs} document into code. In Drasil, this roughly appears as
\refRoughNetworkOfDomains{}, where the nodes are domains, and the arrows
represent mappings between them. However, this sketch is only rough;
realistically, the individual nodes are the ``domains of the \aclp{dsl}'' (i.e.,
the top-level domains they belong to, and not an accurate depiction of all the
\aclp{dsl} that actually exist in Drasil).

\roughNetworkOfDomains{}

As Drasil focuses on the generative software development of \acs{scs}, capturing
the domain of scientific knowledge is at the forefront of its priority list. The
depth and breadth of the network of domains is directly related to how many
opportunities for domain-specific transformations we can perform on a specific
pool of knowledge\todo{I feel like I should be able to cite Czarnecki2005 again
      here, but this isn't really how he worded it, is it fair to cite him here,
      or should I provide my own justification?}.

Drasil currently relies on a single universal untyped mathematical language to
describe general scientific and mathematical knowledge (including, but not
limited to, equations, relations, theories, derivations, constraints, and
definitions).

\intodo{Code snippet: Encoding of a theory using a RelationConcept.}

However, as general-purpose programming languages are to domain-specific
languages, a single universal mathematical language is to a series of formalized
and structured theory-specific languages. In other words, Drasils reliance on a
single mathematical language is limiting because of the complexity associated
with interpreting its terms, which lack information about the \textit{domain}
(science and mathematics).

As a result, transforming encoded theories into other forms (such as code) is a
complex task (similar to the complexity associated with transpiling a
general-purpose program into another â€” an exercise in futility!). Drasil is
unable to make intended and appropriate usage of the encoded mathematical
theories because of a lack of information about the structure of the
mathematical expressions. Since the language is also universal, there is
difficulty in separation of expression term-concern (you wouldn't worry about
derivatives if you were writing down expressions on your standard calculator,
because your calculator likely doesn't understand what derivatives are!). For
example, converting a universal mathematical language into Java will be
difficult, as there are many terms not immediately expressible. Additionally,
due to Drasils lack of type information about its mathematical expression
language, invalid expressions (and hence, domain knowledge) are possible to be
written, causing further issues in reliable formation and transformation into
usable high-quality \acs{scs}. Together, these issues fundamentally have to do
with the depth and breadth of the scientific knowledge: we aim to enable Drasils
network of domain knowledge to grow, and grow it (to some degree).

Finally, as Drasils network of domains continues to grow in different aspects
(such as creating new kinds of chunks, and creating type parameters for existing
chunks), Drasil faces difficulties in scaling its database of knowledge because
of its typed nature.

\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:intro:researchquestions}

\begin{enumerate}

      \item[\namedlabel{rq:lang_division}{RQ1}] Drasil has a language of simple
            mathematical expressions that are used in multiple contexts. But not
            all expressions are valid in all contexts. How do we fix that?

      \item[\namedlabel{rq:modelkinds}{RQ2}] Drasil's current encoding of
            ``theories'' are essentially black boxes. We would like to be able
            to use some structural information present in the short list of the
            ``kinds'' of theories that show up in scientific computing. How do
            we codify that?

      \item[\namedlabel{rq:typing}{RQ3}] How can we ensure that our language(s)
            of simple mathematical expressions admits only valid expressions?

      \item[\namedlabel{rq:chunkdb}{RQ4}] Our current ``typed'' approach to
            collecting different kinds of data is hard to extend. How can we
            make it easier to extend?

\end{enumerate}

\section{Contributions of the Author}
\label{sec:intro:contributions}

In listed code snippets, I will refer to at least two major points of time in
relation to Drasils development (time measured by their git blob hash):
``current''\footnote{Blob hash: dc3674274edb00b1ae0d63e04ba03729e1dbc6f9} and
``original''\footnote{Blob hash: 9c26b43d3e30c3f618e534a3f176a5152729af74}
\todo{Switch these blob hashes to blob tags.}. The ``original'' code refers to a
code snippet as it was written before I was onboarded to Drasil. The ``current''
code includes my work, at least, but might also include the work of others who
were also contributing to the project while I was actively contributing. The
work of others might include, but not limited to, code formatting, code
commenting, and extensions.

Drasil has existed since 2014, and has already seen success in its case studies,
which are used to guide the development of Drasil. Drasils focus on \acs{scs}
relies on knowledge of mathematical theories and language, for which Drasil has
a working understanding of before this work. However, some case studies were
unable to participate in code generation due to a lack of flexible theory
information (\ref{rq:modelkinds}), or just being inapplicable. This work
contributes to structuring theory information and allowing for future developers
to encode more kinds of theories and their relationships with other things
(discussed in \Cref{chap:modelkinds}). The solution builds on a prototype by Dr.
Jacques Carette\todo{Cite Dr. Carettes ModelKinds prototype.} that facilitates
structured theories to define relationships between ``code'' and ``theories.''

Theories rely on mathematical expressions as well. We commonly differ the usable
set of language in different contexts (you are free to write a lot more on your
pencil and paper derivations than on your typical calculator). To obtain
information about the expressibility in different contexts, we divide the
expression language using a \acs{ttf} \cite{Carette2009} encoding, with a
\acsp{gadt} backend for structural edits (\Cref{chap:modelkinds}). However,
``expressibility'' also relies on the expressions adhering to a precise
syntactic set of rules. As such, we build a system of typing rules for the
expression language (\Cref{chap:typedExpr}).

Finally, to enable capturing data with type parameters and generally scale
Drasils knowledge database (\ref{rq:chunkdb}), this work merges the typed
database collections into a single untyped, yet type-preserving, database
(discussed in \Cref{chap:storingChunks}).

\section{Thesis Outline}
\label{sec:intro:outline}

In \Cref{chap:ideology}, we discuss the focal ideology underpinning this work
and Drasil. \Cref{chap:drasil} describes Drasil, the host project carrying the
fruits of this work. \Cref{chap:modelkinds} discusses how theories are encoded
in Drasil (\ref{rq:modelkinds}), the issues associated with using a single
universal mathematical language to describe theories (\ref{rq:lang_division}),
and how we can resolve these problems. \Cref{chap:typedExpr} describes issues
associated with the formation of mathematical expressions (\ref{rq:typing}).
\Cref{chap:storingChunks} focuses on how Drasil stores information, and how it
can be scaled.
