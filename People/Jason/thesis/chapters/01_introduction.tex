As the world increasingly relies on software and non-executable software
artifacts, the software becomes increasingly scrutinized in multiple facets.
Does a piece of software do what I want/need? Is it stable? Is it reliable? What
methods does it use? What do its components mean? Are its outputs accurate and
precise? Is it performant? Is it efficient? Further, to each answer, one might
ask: How do we know? Often, we look to the source code and its development to
justify responses to these questions. Where a requirements specification and a
software design is built, we can spend time investigating that the source code
conforms to the manuals, and that the manuals form satisfactory answers to our
questions. Where a manual is not built, we must spend time studying source code
to respond to these questions, perhaps even comparing them to a control group
program. However, this is terribly arduous process. Realistically, the answers
to these questions should have been already well-understood before the final
software product was formed, even if the answer was to ignore the question until
later. Drasil \cite{Drasil2021} looks to form answers to these same questions
through \textit{definition}. Using generative techniques, Drasil builds software
that conforms to specifications \textit{perfectly} by having all relevant
information of the specifications and how they translate into some software
artifacts well-understood to Drasil. This thesis aims to explore these ideas
through exploring capturing mathematical knowledge in Drasil.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:intro:problemStatement}

As part of Drasil's focus, this mathematical knowledge must become sufficiently
codified such that users may be able to automatically build a program that
satisfies an \acs{srs} document. In other words, building programs exactly
according to the precise problem it solves by understanding the relevant
definitions and descriptions (using a specific \acs{srs}). By doing this, Drasil
will be able to reliably and flexibly generate a host of \acs{stem}-related
software artifacts.

\section{Contributions of the Author}
\label{sec:intro:contributions}

Dr. Jacques Carette had already built a prototype solution \todo{cite appendix
entry of code? I'm not sure, yet, how I should cite what Dr. Carette had already
written.} for the issue of transcribed theories in Drasil not exposing enough
information for reliable code generation (as discussed in
\Cref{chap:modelkinds}). Relying on Dr. Jacques Carettes prototype, A current
implementation and other re-designs in the works have been developed by the
author of this work. Both issues discussed in \Cref{chap:modelkinds} and
\Cref{chap:typedExpr} were discussed before the author had joined the Drasil
research group. Drasil, and the expression language in particular, had been
constructed before this work.

\section{Thesis Outline}
\label{sec:intro:outline}

In \Cref{chap:ideology}, we discuss the focal ideology underpinning this work
and Drasil. \Cref{chap:drasil} describes Drasil, the host project carrying the
fruits of this work. \Cref{chap:modelkinds} discusses how theories are encoded
in Drasil, the issues associated with using a single universal mathematical
language to describe theories, and how we can resolve these problems.
\Cref{chap:typedExpr} describes residual issues associated with validating and
transcribing mathematical expressions. \Cref{chap:knowledgeMgmt} continues to
discuss the ways in which general knowledge and theories are encoded in Drasil,
and methods for altering their encoding, leading into \cref{chap:futureWork},
where we discuss future work.
