Software developers pull on their understanding of problems to build software
solutions. Working together, developers similarly pull their understanding from
a shared pool of knowledge. Often, developers share their knowledge through
documentation, keeping every product owner\footnote{For our purposes, defining a
``product owner'' as all people that have any responsibility in the development
of a software artifact.} ``in the loop.'' As knowledge and requirements change,
software implementations trail behind the current needs and understand, until
developers manually update the code. Additionally, communication of information
may be ambiguous at times, leading to logical issues. By applying generative
techniques to software development, we may have some, or \textit{all}, of the
manual updates performed for us.

Drasil \cite{Drasil2021} is an exploration of applying generative techniques to
well-understood domains to create an alternative way of developing software.
Focused on building \ACF{scs}, Drasil allows users to describe scientific
problems using an abstracted \ACF{srs} template to automatically build a
software solution conforming to the specifications outlined. However, Drasil is
only capable of generating software for the problems that it has sufficiently
``understood'' (i.e., ones that have been sufficiently dissected and encoded in
Drasil).

With a focus on scientific theories and mathematical expressions, in this
thesis, we aim to make some improvements to how Drasil captures certain kinds of
knowledge. However, we will also make improvements to how Drasil stores
knowledge in general as well.

\section{Background: Drasil}
\label{chap:introduction:sec:background}

\porthref{Drasil}{https://jacquescarette.github.io/Drasil/} is a software suite
for generating software from well-formed, principled ``stories.'' Focused on
\ACF{scs}, Drasil allows users to ``fill in the blanks'' to describe their
scientific problems using a precise \ACF{srs} format \cite{SmithAndLai2005}. By
providing sufficient information in the ``blanks,'' Drasil is able to generate
to use the relevant information to generate various software artifacts,
including whole programs (in various target languages), build tools, and
documentation. The ``blanks'' are holes for \textit{domain-specific knowledge}
and are filled in using one of many \ACFP{dsl}. Each individual fragment of
knowledge in Drasil is known as a ``chunk,'' and we encode each useful idea
necessary to discuss/build our desired software artifacts as chunks using
\acsp{dsl}. For example, if we wanted to encode a variable, \(\theta{}_{c}\),
representing the firing angle of a cannon\footnote{Running example based on
      Drasils \acs{projectile} case study.}, we might write:

\exampleAngleVariableEncoding{}

\refExampleAngleVariableEncoding{} encodes the variable with a \acs{uid}
(``desiredFiringAngle''), a short name (``desired firing angle''), long name
(``needed firing angle for a cannon to hit a target''), a symbol
(\(\theta{}_{c}\)), and a unit (radians). The many used chunks and \acsp{dsl}
make up a \textit{network of domains} \cite{Czarnecki2005}, which allow Drasil
to make domain-specific transformations, such as the one most desired in Drasil:
generating computation software conforming to a precise \acs{srs}.

\roughNetworkOfDomainsIntro{}

Roughly, \refRoughNetworkOfDomainsIntro{} shows how Drasils \textit{Smith et
      al.} knowledge transformer works, with each node representing a domain of
knowledge, and each arrow representing a mapping between them. Drasil users
mostly enter in their scientific knowledge near the ``top'' of the diagram to
form a coherent \acs{srs} abstraction using relevant \acsp{dsl}. Drasil takes
their \acs{srs} abstraction, audits it, and allows the user to pick from a
series of options to generate software that conforming to the scientific problem
encoded.

The ``scientific knowledge'' at the top of the diagram is not necessarily a
complete capture of all scientific knowledge, of course. Rather, it is a
``bubble''/collection of the scientific knowledge. Drasils development follows
the needs of a series of manually built case studies, using them as ``seeding''
data to navigate development and language needs to adequately discuss the
software and the ideas used to form it. As Drasil is ``taught'' more
information\footnote{By providing it with a means of discussing relevant ideas,
      using \aclp{dsl}.}, Drasils span of producible artifacts widens. At the moment,
not all case studies in Drasil contain sufficient information for Drasil to
generate code for.

Some case studies are currently in-progress (i.e., incomplete) and won't be a
focus of this work, but left for future work by others. Instead, we will focus
on those which \textit{we} understand how to manually produce code for.
Specifically, we will largely focus on a common denominator: strengthening
mathematical knowledge capture, but we will also spend time learning how to
scale Drasils knowledge (chunk) database against expansion in further chunk type
creation.

\subsection{Theories and Expressions}

One of the most important aspect of describing scientific problems is:
describing the relevant \textit{theories}. Drasil relies on users describing
theory knowledge using \textit{relations} through a \textit{single universal
      untyped mathematical expression language}. To be clear, this means that Drasil
relies on on-demand interpretation and comprehension of \textit{terms} from this
expression language. Equations, relations, derivations, constraints, and
definitions are all described using this single language. However, the language
does not contain sufficient ``depth'' to adequately make use of its encoded
information. In other words, this expression language is a ``lower-level'' view
of the information we really need to make domain-specific transformations,

Drasil attempts to use the \textit{theories} gathered from a user-filled
\acs{srs} to understand what problem they intended to describe (i.e.,
calculating the inputs and outputs, and a sequence of calculation steps that go
from the former to the latter). Each theory needs to be sufficiently understood
to produce calculation steps that we can use. For example, if we wanted to
define our firing angle variable (\refExampleAngleVariableEncoding{}) in terms
of the distance of the target, gravity, and the initial
velocity\footnote{Assuming no air drag or resistance}, we might write:
\(\arcsin{}(\mathit{targetDistanceFromCannon} \cdot{} g / v^2) / 2\). In Drasil,
we might encode this as \refExampleAngleEquationEncoding{}.

\exampleAngleEquationEncoding{}

With this theory encoding, we have enough information to generate a visually
pleasing description box for the \acs{srs} \LaTeX{} and \acs{html} documents
(\refExampleAngleEquationEncodingToTeX{}). Converting to typesetting languages
is reasonably unproblematic because they only use the theory knowledge in a
shallow light (displaying). More importantly, we can also convert this theory to
Python code as well:

\exampleAngleEquationEncodingToPython{}

However, this example is reasonably simple. If we were handed an equation of
this \(\nu{} = f(x,y,z)\) form, it's somewhat reasonable, but perhaps dubious,
to assume that one way to define \(\nu{}\) is \(f(x,y,z)\). However, if we were
handed an equivalent, scrambled version of it, then we can assume less
information about it. For example, if we re-wrote the equation for
\refExampleAngleEquationEncoding{} as \(\mathit{targetDistanceFromCannon}
\cdot{} g = v^2\sin{}(2\theta{}_c)\), then we've lost the critical
\textit{definition} assumption that we used to write the python code.
Automatically isolating for \(\theta_c\) is possible, but we're interested in
the definitional information, and we want it as readily-available as possible.
Now, with this scrambled variant as well, we similarly can't typeset it in the
expected definitional form we desired, even though the relation is equivalent.
With more complex theories, more issues arise. For example, defining theories
with multiple definitions lacks information about which definition to ``pick''
for software implementations, \acsp{ode} lack information about solving methods,
and some theories may be purely abstract, and entirely unusable for code
generation. The current encoding of theories lacks information about the
structure of the theories. Additionally, we also lack information about when
expression terms are usable in the context of code (e.g., expressions involving
derivatives are not always directly usable in code), where we expect them to be
directly translatable to programming languages. As a result, knowing \textit{how
      to} and \textit{when you can} transform captured theories into other forms (such
as executable code) is a complex task (similar to the complexity associated with
transpiling a general-purpose program into another \textemdash{} an exercise in
futility!).

With the theory encoding above, we also never discussed what
\(\mathit{targetDistanceFromCannon}\), \(g\), nor \(v\) were. On paper and
pencil, it's fairly reasonable to assume that they are all some numeric type.
However, when we generate software, we expect it to be \textit{executed}, and
hence undergo a type checking phase by compilers/interpreters. As the expression
language is currently untyped, Drasil currently allows software generation with
``ill-typed'' (according to the respective compilers and interpreters)
expressions. In particular, for example, this poses problem for Swift code
generation because Swift doesn't allow numeric addition if both operants are not
of the same type, while Java uses implicit type coercion to mask these issues.
Ultimately, this means that more time is spent developing and debugging
generated artifacts than we would like. We would prefer that generated software
come with an assurance of usability.

\subsection{Capturing (\& Remembering) Everything}

Knowledge capture is at the heart of Drasil. It is what allows Drasil to make
domain-specific interpretations that we're interested in, to ultimately generate
software artifacts. \textit{Chunks} are unique instances of knowledge, tagged
with a \acs{uid} (for referencing them) and a \textit{type} (for understanding
their structure). The chunk is unique with respect to a global ``chunk
database'' that Drasil registers all chunk into. At the moment, Drasils chunk
database uses a series of typed maps (\refOriginalChunkDBHaskell{}) with
\acs{uid} keys and typed chunk values. This means that as we create new types of
chunks in Drasil, the list of maps in the database will grow. Additionally, the
list of types will have to be known before using Drasil, which means that
extending the list of chunks is difficult for users. In other words, the current
chunk database is not \textit{extensible} because of it's typed nature.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:intro:problemStatement}

\begin{writingdirectives}
      \item Key problems:
      \begin{itemize}
            \item theory structural knowledge
            \item scope of the expression language and information about theory usage
            \item expression language is untyped
            \item scaling against new types
      \end{itemize}
\end{writingdirectives}

Drasil isn't able to adequately make domain-specific interpretations of encoded
theories because it lacks structural information about the theories. Theories
also don't provide static information about the contexts in which they are
usable, partially because the underlying expression language exposes little
information about this too. Additionally, Drasils lack of type information stops
us from reliably generating usable software (in particular, there is no
assurance of type checking). Together, these issues affect our ability to
reliably and flexibly generate software. Finally, Drasils chunk database is not
extensible, limited admissible chunk types to only those that exist in core
Drasil.

\subsection{Research Questions}
\label{sec:intro:researchquestions}

\begin{enumerate}

      \item[\namedlabel{rq:modelkinds}{RQ1}] Drasil's current encoding of
            ``theories'' are essentially black boxes. We would like to be able
            to use some structural information present in the short list of the
            ``kinds'' of theories that show up in scientific computing. How do
            we codify that?

      \item[\namedlabel{rq:lang_division}{RQ2}] Drasils theory encodings rely on
            a single mathematical expression language, and doesn't expose
            information about applicability to different contexts. In each
            context (e.g., code, theories, and common arithmetic), certain terms
            of the expression language should be treated differently, or are
            simply inapplicable. How can we restrict term usage by context?

      \item[\namedlabel{rq:typing}{RQ3}] How can we ensure that our mathematical
            expression language admits only valid expressions?

      \item[\namedlabel{rq:chunkdb}{RQ4}] Our current ``typed'' approach to
            collecting different kinds of data is hard to extend. How can we
            make it easier to extend?

\end{enumerate}

\section{Contributions of the Author}
\label{sec:intro:contributions}

In listed code snippets, I will refer to at least two major points of time in
relation to Drasils development (time measured by their git blob hash):
``current''\footnote{Blob hash: dc3674274edb00b1ae0d63e04ba03729e1dbc6f9} and
``original''\footnote{Blob hash: 9c26b43d3e30c3f618e534a3f176a5152729af74}
\latertodo{Switch these blob hashes to blob tags}. The ``original'' code refers
to a code snippet as it was written before I was onboarded to Drasil. The
``current'' code includes my work, at least, but might also include the work of
others who were also contributing to the project while I was actively
contributing. The work of others might include, but not limited to, code
formatting, code commenting, and extensions.

Notable contributions include:

\begin{itemize}

      \item Splitting the mathematical expression language into 3, each with
            their own intended area of usage, but using a \acs{ttf}
            \cite{Carette2009} to keep same user-friendliness in expression
            transcription (resolving \Cref{rq:lang_division}).

      \item Implementing \ModelKinds{} to expose theory structure knowledge,
            creating opportunity for new domain-specific interpretation of
            theory knowledge (resolving \Cref{rq:modelkinds}). The solution
            builds on a prototype by Dr. Jacques Carette\footnote{Unfortunately,
                  the code associated with the prototype had been deleted.}.

      \item Adding type checking and inference to mathematical expression
            languages (resolving \Cref{rq:typing}).

      \item Created an extensible chunk database prototype that can register
            chunks with types external to core Drasil and chunks with type
            parameters (resolving \Cref{rq:chunkdb}).

\end{itemize}

\section{Thesis Outline}
\label{sec:intro:outline}

In \Cref{chap:ideology}, we discuss what we can learn from the source code of
general software, and, specifically, how we can abstract over them to form
similar software, varying over certain aspects of the software, to make the
background knowledge reusable. \Cref{chap:drasil} discusses Drasil, a software
suite for generating software from coherent descriptions of scientific problems.
\Cref{chap:modelkinds} discusses how Drasil captures and uses theories to
generate code, and how we improved the capture, to create more opportunity for
domain-specific interpretation of the theories (\ref{rq:modelkinds})
\Cref{chap:lang-division} discusses how Drasil encodes mathematical expressions,
and issues associated (\ref{rq:lang_division}). \Cref{chap:more-theory-kinds}
revisits the existing captured theories in Drasil, rebuilding them with
specialized encodings for others to use as needed. \Cref{chap:typed-expr}
discusses issues associated with the formation of mathematical expressions and
what it means for expressions to be ``well-formed'' (\ref{rq:typing}).
\Cref{chap:storingChunks} focuses on how Drasil stores information, and how it
can scale against future development of Drasil and libraries (\ref{rq:chunkdb}).
