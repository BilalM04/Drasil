Unless otherwise stated (through citation or otherwise), this thesis is the work
of my own (Jason Balaci). In particular, through Dr. Jacques Carettes project
aims, direction, and supervision, I was able to complete this work.

This thesis contributes to Drasil, a research project principally investigated
by Dr. Jacques Carette and Dr. Spencer Smith, and contributed to by many
graduates before me.
