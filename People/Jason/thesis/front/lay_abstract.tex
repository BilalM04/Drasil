Drasil~\cite{Drasil2021} is a program for breaking up your ideas into small,
reusable, pieces, and explaining how your ideas relate to each other and can
ultimately be used to systematically produce other programs, similar to an
assembly line. Focusing on building \ACF{scs}, Drasil uses a well-understood
dissection of \acs{scs} using a \ACF{srs} template~\cite{SmithAndLai2005} to
provide users with a means of explaining their scientific problems using a
common, shared language that Drasil programmers have already built. In this
work, we contribute to Drasil. We focus on 4 research questions: (1) allowing
users of Drasil to encode more kinds of theories in Drasil and the \acs{srs}
templates, (2) restricting mathematical language in program generation to only
that which we can, (3) creating a system of rules that explain which
mathematical expressions are valid and understandable, and (4) extend Drasil's
ability to store any kind of idea in Drasil and add more kinds.
