\chapter{Lay Abstract}
\label{chap:lay_abstract}

Drasil is a program for breaking up your ideas into small, reusable, pieces, and
explaining how your ideas relate to each other and can ultimately be used to
systematically produce other programs, similar to an assembly line. Focusing on
building \ACF{scs}, Drasil uses a well-understood dissection of \acs{scs} using
a \ACF{srs} template to provide users with a means of explaining their
scientific problems using a common, shared language that Drasil programmers have
already built. In this work, we contribute to Drasil, focusing on 4 areas: (1)
allowing users of Drasil to encode more kinds of theories in Drasil and the
\acs{srs} templates, (2) dividing up the mathematical expression language for
usage in different contexts, (3) creating a system of rules that explain which
mathematical expressions are valid and understandable, and (4) unlock Drasil's
ability to store more kinds of idea in Drasil and easily add more kinds.
