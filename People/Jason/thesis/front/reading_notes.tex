\chapter{Reading Notes}
\label{chap:reading_notes}

Before reading this thesis, I encourage you to read through these few notes,
keeping them in mind while reading.

\begin{itemize}

    \item This report is available in two (2) flavours: one intended for
          printing, and one intended for viewing on your computer (the default).
          The one intended for viewing on your computer will have hyperlinks
          coloured in \textcolor{red}{red} and does not show website references
          explicitly. In particular, all ``Source Code'' content will link
          directly to a snippet of code. The copy intended for printing will
          show website references explicitly by adding footnotes to hyperlinks.

    \item Drasils \porthref{source
              code}{https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil} is publicly
          available.

          \begin{itemize}

              \item Similarly, the \porthref{source
                        code}{https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/tree/master/People/Jason/thesis}
                    for this thesis is public.

          \end{itemize}

    \item ``Source Code'' snippets with ``Original'' in their title show code
          snippets as they appeared \textit{before} this work. Snippets with
          ``Current'' in their title show code snippets which include some of my
          work. However, ``Current'' code snippets may also contain the works of
          others while I was also working.

          \begin{itemize}
              \item ``Original'' snippets follow blob hash:
                    9c26b43d3e30c3f618e534a3f176a5152729af74
              \item ``Current'' snippets follow blob hash:
                    dc3674274edb00b1ae0d63e04ba03729e1dbc6f9
          \end{itemize}

          \intodo{Switch these blob hashes to blob tags.}

    \item At times, we will refer to ``software artifacts'' as just
         ``artifacts.''

    \item Similarly, when we refer to ``Haskell,'' we are referring to the
          Haskell 2010 specification \cite{Haskell2010}, compiled by \acs{ghc}
          8.8.4 \cite{GHC884}.

\end{itemize}
